🧠 CV Screener App

📋 Overview

The CV Screener App is a smart, time-saving tool that helps recruiters, hiring teams, and HR professionals quickly identify the most relevant candidates. It allows the user to upload multiple CVs (in PDF or text format) and automatically score them based on specific keywords or skills they are looking for. After screening, users can easily download the results as a spreadsheet, making it simple to share or sort candidate scores.

⚙️ Key Features

📂 Bulk Uploads: Upload multiple CVs at once (supports .pdf and .txt files).

📊 Automated Scoring: Each CV is analyzed and scored based on keyword occurrences.

📥 Export Option: Download the final results as a spreadsheet (e.g., CSV or Excel) for easy review and sharing.

🧰 Tech Stack

-  Backend: Python

-  Frontend: HTML + JavaScript

🚀 How It Works

1.  Enter the keywords or skills you want to check for.
2.  Upload one or more CVs in PDF or text format.
3.  Click Analyze, the app scans and scores each CV.
4.  View ranked results on screen.

💡 Why It Matters

-  Screening hundreds of CVs manually is time-consuming and error-prone. This app automates that process, giving recruiters a fast and fair way to identify top candidates — so you can spend more time on interviews, not filtering.
